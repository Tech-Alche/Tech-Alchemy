Advanced Database Operations using SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) which basically means that it allows us to translate python classes and python objects to database tables and database entries and when we work with these python objects. For an example we create a new python object we delete it we change it whatever the respective action will also be translated into a database action without us having to write any SQL code so we donâ€™t need to do anything like create table insert into select from everything will be done automatically by SQLAlchemy.
